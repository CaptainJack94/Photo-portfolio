&nbsp;                                            Welcome to my portfolio!



Hi, I'm Jack from Ripley in Derbyshire and I'm an amateur photographer with a lovely of landscapes and wildlife. This portfolio is a presentation of my travels around the UK and abroad captured on both my Google Pixel and Canon Powershot.

I have a love of the outdoors and have volunteered on wildlife related projects in the Seychelles and South Africa where a lot of my photos are from.
